**Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression**

In this project, we build a classification system in Python that predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine based on SONAR signal data. We use the Logistic Regression model for this binary classification task. The entire implementation and analysis are carried out using Google Colaboratory, allowing for efficient coding, testing, and visualization in a cloud-based environment.
